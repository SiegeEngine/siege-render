We use a typical "metalness" workflow.

Albedo map:
  Base color. Used for both diffuse and specular.

AO:
  Ambient occlusion. Critical! (Albedo * AO) = traditional diffuse map.
  Multiply by AO for ambient component *AND* diffuse component of lighting.
  (but not specular component).
  (black = occluded)

Cavity:
  Specular light occlusion. Critical if it exists! (Albedo * Cavity) is for specular
  portion.
  (black = occluded)

Specular/Reflectivity
  [we do not use this -- this is for a 'specular' workflow]

Gloss/Smoothness -or- Roughness
  These maps are inverses of each other.
  This dictates the sharpness/intensity of specular reflections.
  From megascans, this is matched to a GGX BRDF.

Normal (tangent-space)
  Represents normal directions at each pixel.
  Red=x, Green=y, Blue=z.

Displacement
  Encodes a heightmap for the texture.
  White = 10cm, Gray = 0cm, Black = -10cm

Bump
  [we do not use this -- like displacement, but used in offline contexts]
  Resolution is finer (+/- 0.25 cm)

NormalBump
  [we do not use this -- used in offline contexts]

Opacity
  Represents transparency of a material.
  White=opaque, black=transparent

Translucency
  Represents sub-surface scattering when lit from behind
  bright color = translucent, dark color = opaque

Fuzz
  Represents a mask for a rough fuzzy surface such as moss.
  Gives extra diffusion to a surface.
  bright = fuzzy, dark = clear
