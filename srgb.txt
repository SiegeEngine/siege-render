Encoding makes the numbers larger/whiter.

Linear:							sRGB encoded
  0.0 -- is black					0.0
  1.0 -- is the white point				1.0
  0.18 is "middle gray"					0.4613561295
  0.21404						0.5
  0.5							0.735

TEST 1:
  Surface format: B8G8R8A8_UNorm
  Surface color space: SRGBNonLinear
  I wrote middle gray.
  The output was DARKER than middle gray.

  Conclusion:  I need to encoded it into SRGB, since the format is UNorm, but the
    expected color space is SRGB.

TEST 2:
  Surface format: B8G8R8A8_sRGB
  Surface color space: SRGBNonLinear
  I wrote middle gray.
  The output was IDENTICAL to middle gray.

  Conclusion:  I dont need to encode it into SRGB, since the format is sRGB and that
    means vulkan does it for me.
