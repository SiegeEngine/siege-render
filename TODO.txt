Try adjusting Params (bloom/blur), see how it works.  I believe blur_level is not yet
  honored, so fix that.

Threading: We know that our AMD card only has one graphics queue, so this setup will
  have to be an alternate code path.  See THREADING.txt
  * We DONT need a separate queue - we can have several renderpasses that are not
    dependent on each other
  * Drivers optimize better within a renderpass than across them, so do that as much
    as we can - limitation is you cannot blur, you can only get to your same pixel.
  * Look into transient attachments

load_shader() - fix skipping of bad bytes (error instead)

Low priority:
  target_data.rs:
    Consider VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL_KHR,
    which allows use as a depth-stencil attachment where depth is read-only
    which is useful for shading phase - allows ImageUsage::Sampled along
    with ImageUsage::DepthStencilAttachment

  target_data.rs:
    Can the bloom images be half dimension?

  mesh.rs:
    texture images
    maybe uniform buffers
    maybe per-mesh vec4() values

  Allow unmapping (and remapping) of memory. Chunk could unmap if all blocks
    release some map-lock variable.
