1. BloomFilterH pipeline, BloomVMerge pipeline, and bloom_gfx
2. PostPipeline post_gfx


Low priority:
  target_data.rs:
    Consider VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_READ_ONLY_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL_KHR,
    which allows use as a depth-stencil attachment where depth is read-only
    which is useful for shading phase - allows ImageUsage::Sampled along
    with ImageUsage::DepthStencilAttachment

  target_data.rs:
    Can the bloom images be half dimension?

  mesh.rs:
    texture images
    maybe uniform buffers
    maybe per-mesh vec4() values
